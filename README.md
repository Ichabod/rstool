Tool for approximating Reachable Sets (Feasibility Problem Algorithm)

The Software is based on the doctoral thesis "A Feasibility Problem Approach For Reachable Set Approximation" of Jahn. The content is currently in its originally submitted state and not currently unter further development. If someone is interested to continue to work on this software I will be happy to participate in development. :-) Just let me know.
